Belgium midfielder Marouane Fellaini has thanked Jose Mourinho for his "faith" after signing a new two-year contract at Manchester United.

Paragraph 1
The 30-year-old, whose previous deal was due to expire on 30 June, had been expected to leave Old Trafford.

Paragraph 2
United manager Jose Mourinho said he wanted to keep Fellaini and the club spent the past few months trying to persuade him to stay.

Paragraph 3
"I made this decision because I am very happy here," said Fellaini.

Paragraph 4
"I feel like this team, under Jose, still has a lot we want to achieve. I would like to say a special thank you to Jose for the faith he has always shown in me."

Paragraph 5
Fellaini has scored 20 goals in 156 appearances for United since a £27m move from Everton in 2013.

Paragraph 6
His new contract gives the option for a further season.

Paragraph 7
"I am very happy Marouane is staying with us," said Mourinho. "I always believed in his desire to stay with the club and I am delighted that he has signed a new contract."

Paragraph 8
Fellaini became David Moyes' first significant signing after he replaced Sir Alex Ferguson, but endured two spells out of the team last season because of a knee injury that eventually required surgery.

Paragraph 9
He missed the FA Cup final defeat by Chelsea at Wembley in May with a muscle strain.
